This project produces the website for the Irish Inter-Firms Gaming League (IIGL). 

The IIGL (pronounced _iggle_) is an Irish video gaming league where companies compete against each other for charities. It's the eSports equivalent of inter-firms GAA; and just like other inter-firms sports leagues, the IIGL is run voluntarily by passionate individuals who work regular day jobs.

The goal of the IIGL is fairly simple: to promote gaming. We use [Battlefy](https://battlefy.com/) as the tournament platform because it's free, automated and awesome! Since we're just getting started we're looking at YOU to become part of the foundations, whether it's to help with the website, moderating the tournaments, or admin.

This website was made with all these sexy technologies:
* [Node](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
* [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular)
* [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express).

## Install

Clone the repo and run `npm install`.

## Start a server

Run the handy little bash script `start_server.sh` and the website should open. Add the `--prod` flag to start the server in production mode, building and packing the application for speedier surfing of the site.
