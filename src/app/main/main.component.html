    <hr style="width: 200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>
      The IIGL is the eSports equivalent of inter-firms GAA or any
      other inter-firms sport; and just like other inter-firms sports leagues, the IIGL is run voluntarily by passionate
      individuals who work regular day jobs. The goal of the IIGL is fairly simple: to promote gaming. We use Battlefy
      as the tournament platform because it is free, automated and awesome!
    </p>
    <h3 class="w3-text-light-grey">So why participate?</h3>
    <p>
      Same reason anyone does anything competitively... to win! Here at the IIGL we've substituted the traditional
      wooden shield with our walls of fame. Walls plural? Yup, we have a wall for every game and there's nothing
      stopping you getting your name on all of them! Save for maybe the competition! Also, since we're just getting
      started we're looking at YOU to become part of the foundations!
