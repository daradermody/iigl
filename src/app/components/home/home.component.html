            against each other for the prestige of... a name on a wall.</p>

        The IIGL is the eSports equivalent of inter-firms GAA or any other inter-firms sport; and just like other
        inter-firms sports leagues, the IIGL is run voluntarily by passionate individuals who work regular day jobs. The
        goal of the IIGL is fairly simple: to promote gaming. We use Battlefy as the tournament platform because it's
        free, automated and awesome!

      <p>
        If you work for a company, and think you're the bees knees at online video games, round up some people together
        and submit a team. Why? Same reason anyone does anything competitively... to win! Here at the IIGL we've
        substituted the traditional wooden shield with our <a routerLink="/wallOfFame">walls of fame</a>. Walls plural?
        Yup, we have a wall for every game and there's nothing stopping you getting your name on all of them! Save for
        maybe the competition! Also, since we're just getting started we're looking at YOU to become part of the
        foundations!
