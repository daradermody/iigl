          against each other for the prestige of... a name on a wall!</p>

        The IIGL is the Esports equivalent of interfirms soccer or GAA. It is run voluntarily by passionate individuals who work regular day jobs. The goal is to promote gaming and raise money for charaties in Ireland. Tournaments are run using Battlefy.
      </p>
      <p>
The IIGL was founded on the principle that you are never too old to game!
        There are lots of things we as a community can do to promote the normalisation of gaming in Irish society.
        We think that one of them is telling your co-workers that you are competing in the Irish Interfirms Gaming League this weekend! And the fact that it's all in aid of charity should certainly help!
